# Yelp_Application
A data analysis application for Yelp.com’s business review data.

This target application runs queries on the Yelp data and extracts useful information. The primary users for this application will be potential customers seeking for businesses and users that match their search criteria. Your application will have a user interface that provides the user the available business categories (main, sub-categories), the attributes associated with each business category along with business review and yelp user information associated with each business category. Using this application the user will search for the businesses from various business categories that have the properties (attributes) the user is looking for.

In this application, the user can filter the search results using available business attributes (i.e. facets) such as category, sub-category, attributes, reviews, stars and votes. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the search— the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
